    Any modifications to the repository that are not planned to be merged into the main repository must be clearly communicated to the public. Users must be aware of the differences between the main repository and any forked versions.

    - Inclusion of Other Open Source Projects

    This software may include other open source licensed projects. Users will be informed about these bundled projects and their respective licenses. Any other open source project that has a license prohibiting cross-licensing (i.e., being bundled with other projects) should not be included.

    The owner reserves the right to allow or disallow the commercial use of the software. Commercial entities must obtain explicit permission from the owner for any such use.

    - Impact of Incorporating Other Projects

## LZ4 

https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/LICENSE - As of 16th of Nov. 2024

    This repository uses 2 different licenses :

    - all files in the `lib` directory use a BSD 2-Clause license
    - all other files use a GPL-2.0-or-later license, unless explicitly stated otherwise

    Relevant license is reminded at the top of each source file,
    and with presence of COPYING or LICENSE file in associated directories.

    This model is selected to emphasize that
    files in the `lib` directory are designed to be included into 3rd party applications,
    while all other files, in `programs`, `tests` or `examples`,
    are intended to be used "as is", as part of their intended scenarios,
    with no intention to support 3rd party integration use cases.
